# ProcessorDocumentation

Documentation for my latest processor designs.

## Introduction/History

See https://github.com/ZYSF/gen1cpu for my "first-generation" processor design.

The documentation here is for my "second-generation" or current design (as of 2022).

Major changes to the implementation/s (which I haven't uploaded fully, at least at this stage) include gradually moving towards an algorithmic/autogenerated design which is already capable of producing 32-bit as well as 64-bit implementations. This means some necessary breaking changes were needed, so I decided to branch the documentation off separately while finalising how to continue developing/releasing future implementations.

The contents of this repository is developed from scratch (based on my previous/original designs), and made freely available for whatever purposes (under the terms of "unlicense").
